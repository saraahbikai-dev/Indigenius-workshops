      <h1>Temoya Rug</h1>
      <%# <h3>Description:</h3> %>
      <p>The municipality is also known for the making is Persian-style handknotted rugs. 
        The making of these rugs was begun in 1968 with the aim of creating jobs in the region.
        It was initially sponsored by the Bank of Mexico; later the project was funded by the State of Mexico.
        This project was later abandoned due to poor management, but families here continued to make the rugs on their own.
        In 1999, a new organization, Sociedad Cooperativa de Tapetes Anudados a Mano Temoaya took over 
        but remained independent of the government. Although most rugs are made in a community called San Pedro Arriba, 
        the cooperative's store, Centro Artesanal “Tapetes Mexicanos” is located in San Pedro Abajo.</p>
