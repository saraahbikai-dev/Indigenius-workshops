			The making of these rugs was begun in 1968 with the aim of creating jobs in the region.
			It was initially sponsored by the Bank of Mexico;
	                later the project was funded by the State of Mexico.
	                This project was later abandoned due to poor management, but families here continued to make the rugs on their own.</p></div>
	
 <div class="column" style="background-color:#000000"><p> In 1999, a new organization, Sociedad Cooperativa de Tapetes Anudados a Mano Temoaya took over 
			but remained independent of the government.
	                Although most rugs are made in a community called San Pedro Arriba,
			the cooperative's store, Centro Artesanal “Tapetes Mexicanos” is located in San Pedro Abajo.</p></div>
